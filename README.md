# About the project
On this day, I built a fun "Higher or Lower" game where you compare two INstagram accounts and guess which one has more followers.
We practiced structuring a full game, working with real-style data, and building logic that keeps looping until the player loses. This challenge really sharpened problem-solving skills and made Python feel even more fun to play with.

# What we learned:
- Working with **lists and dictionaries** to manage data  
- **Random selection** to generate new game rounds  
- **Functions** to organize logic cleanly  
- Using **return values** to check if the player is right or wrong  
- Comparing values and building **logical conditions**  
- Formatting data for **clean and readable output**

# How the code works:
- The program randomly picks two celebrity profiles  
- It formats each profile nicely (name, job, country)  
- You choose who you think has more followers  
- A function checks your answer and returns True/False  
- If you’re correct, a new round starts with one account carried forward  
- If you're wrong, then womp womp game over!
